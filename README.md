# cnix nix

**cnix** started as a copy of Misterio's configs but evolved to mirror his main
setup. Over time, I incorporated ideas from colemickens' and fufexan's
configurations and eventually created my own solutions.

This is my daily driverâ€”still a work in progress, with many elements inspired by
the repositories listed below. Check them out if you're seeking ideas.

The goal here is a modular, scalable Nix setup. It uses separate user and system
configurations, managed via `modules.nix` in the hosts and users directories.
I'm also working on a small app to simplify managing these configs.

The three repositories below were key influences, each with a unique take on
flakes.

- [colemickens](https://github.com/colemickens/nixcfg.git)
- [Misterio77](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config.git)
